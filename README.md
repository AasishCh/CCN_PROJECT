# INTRODUCTION (Voice-to-Text)
Voice-to-text conversion is a technology that allows a computer to transcribe human speech into written text. The goal of a voice-to-text conversion project is to develop a system that can accurately transcribe spoken language into text in real-time. This technology has many applications, including accessibility for people with disabilities, and automated speech recognition for customer service and other applications. In a voice-to-text conversion project, the system typically employs a combination of machine learning algorithms and signal processing techniques to analyze speech and transcribe it into text. 
# Architecture
We are planning to use client-server architecture.
# Project Plan based on two weeks iteration
## Iteration 1
* Familiarize ourself with the Streamlit and WebRTC technologies and identify the necessary components and dependencies for the project.
* Implement basic functionalities such as audio recording and converting it to the text.
* Conduct initial tests of the model to ensure that the audio recording and conversion to text are working correctly.
## Iteration 2
* Design the architecture of the system and create a rough prototype of the user interface.
* Conduct tests to evaluate the accuracy of the speech recognition algorithms.
* Make any necessary adjustments to the algorithms based on the results of the tests.
## Iteration 3
* Integrate speech recognition algorithms into the system to transcribe audio into text.
* Improve the user interface and add additional features if possible.

This is what we have planned for the next 6 weeks, soon we will update future iterations.
