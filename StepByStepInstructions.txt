Step-By-Step Guide Instructions:
1.First, you need to install some packages to be able to use Streamlit and perform voice-to-text conversion. You'll need to install the following Python libraries:
Streamlit: This allows you to create interactive web apps.
PyWhisper: This provides support for speech recognition.
PyAudio: This provides support for audio input and output.

2. Next, you need to run two Python files called "Serv.py" and "Serv2.py". You can do this by using the command "python filename.py". Make sure to copy the IP address of both servers.

3. Open the "cli_t.py" file and paste the IP addresses of both servers. Then, run "streamlit run cli_t.py" in the command line. This will start the Streamlit app, where you can upload an audio file to convert it to text and later translate it into a prescribed language of your choice.

If you run into any issues while using the app, make sure to check that you have installed all the necessary packages and dependencies.
